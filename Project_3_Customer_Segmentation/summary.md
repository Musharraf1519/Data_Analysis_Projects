# Project 3: Customer Segmentation – Market Basket Analysis

## 🧠 Objective
Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model. The goal is to identify high-value customers, at-risk customers, and loyal segments for targeted marketing strategies.

## 📦 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravalsmit/customer-segmentation-data)
- **Contents**: Customer demographics, transaction history, purchase frequency, product categories.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- SQL (for querying customer and transaction data)  
- Power BI (for visualization of segments and customer analysis)  
- MySQL/PostgreSQL (for database management)

## 📁 Key SQL Views Created
- total_customer_spend – Total premium spent by each customer
- rfm_scores – Customer RFM scores (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) using NTILE
- customer_lifetime_value – Total and average monthly premium per customer

## 📊 Power BI Visualizations
- KPI Cards:
      - Total Customers
